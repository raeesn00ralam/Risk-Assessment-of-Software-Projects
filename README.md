# Risk-Assessment-of-Software-Projects
In this research, we aim to perform project risk prediction using Artificial Neural Networks and other machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Regression, Logistic Regression, Multilayered Perceptron, and K-Nearest Regression, Artificial Intelligence prediction algorithms that operate over historical data to forecast the conclusions. Currently, the algorithm is designed to predict the hard risks in project development. Outcomes, the accuracy of the model, and expected risk intensity have been the cynosure of this research. The output has been validated with 20 percent of the historical dataset, and the Artificial Neural Networks model has proved to yield 97.99 % percent accurate results with an error value of 0.0040 after training. To forecast overall project and individual factors risk, we considered the Artificial Neural Networks model with Adaptive Moment Estimation optimizer and Sigmoid activation function.
